# Architecture

Four layers. Each one works on its own, every position is an ERC-20, and the
model is only called by the Desk when pricing a trade. Settlement never
touches the model. Interfaces: [`contracts/src/interfaces/`](../contracts/src/interfaces/),
frontend guide: [interfaces.md](interfaces.md). The lessons in brackets come from the
research on Opyn, Pendle, Gnosis CTF, Siren and Cega (2026-09-29).

## Why each rule is there

| Tag | Rule | Precedent |
|---|---|---|
| [1] | Each series has its own USDG escrow, and only factory clones may mint or burn | Opyn Gamma audit C01 (fake oToken redeems from the shared pool); Ribbon/Aevo legacy vaults drained for $2.7M through the shared MarginPool, Dec 2025 |
| [2] | Same terms → same series (CREATE2); a series opens at its strike fixing; the Desk quotes a small standard grid | Opyn fixed expiry at 08:00 UTC against fragmentation; Pendle subsidizes each maturity with incentives |
| [3] | `settle` flips once and stores the payout; NOTE rounds down, WRITER = max − NOTE; no mint after settlement; burn before transfer | Gnosis CTF audit (unbounded minting after resolution); Opyn v1 `msg.value` reuse in a loop ($371k) |
| [4] | Pull-based redemption to any `to`; `settle` moves no tokens | USDG's issuer can freeze, wipe and pause (6 decimals, UUPS, no transfer fee) |
| [5] | No lending-collateral oracle for NOTE yet | Pendle PT-reUSD: a $320k trade → 3% move → $36.4M of Morpho liquidations (Aug 2026) |
| [6] | The Desk is the market; no AMM pools for NOTE | Pendle needed a purpose-built AMM; NOTE's value jumps at every fixing |
| [7] | ERC-20 tokens, not ERC-1155 | Siren lost $3.5M to reentrancy through ERC-1155 receive hooks; CTF needed ERC-20 wrappers |
| [8] | The Desk holds WRITER by default; no promise of WRITER liquidity | Siren, Ribbon and Cega all ended up with the vault as the writer |
| [9] | Caps, ε-band before observations, rounding against the trader | Ribbon auctions cleared 1.7–2.8 vol points below exchange prices |
| [!] | Feed pauses detected by staleness | `oraclePaused()` is absent on the TSLA feed (probed), whatever Chainlink's docs say |

## Decisions baked into the interfaces

- **Implied vol is not a series term.** It changes the price, never the payout. Keeping it
  out of `SeriesTerms` keeps identical notes in one fungible series; vol is set per series
  in the Desk listing.
- **One certified model per product, not per stock or per note.** Every model input is
  relative to the strike, so the stock enters only through vol. K1 round 0 showed one
  network can't cover all term sheets (~18× over the gate), so each model is certified for
  one set of terms. The Desk listing names the pricer for each series; `listSeries` checks
  the series' terms and vol against the pricer's `certifiedRange`. Scaling to many stocks:
  a model with vol as a free input (one per product) if K1 round 2 certifies it, otherwise
  one model per product and vol level.
- **The payout rules are normative** (see `INoteSeries.sol`) and are the ones the Monte Carlo
  teacher prices: accrued coupon, autocall at `>= ac`, knock-in at `< ki`, both latching and
  checked at barrier observations only, and the maturity fixing **one period after the last
  observation**. That extra period is what keeps the knock-in barrier smooth for the model.
- **Each model carries a certified domain** (format v2): pinned note terms, exact derived
  fields, and excluded regions such as the autocall observation-day band. The Stylus contract
  reverts outside it, so a direct caller can't get an unmeasured price either.
- **No demo mode in production contracts.** The demo stages feed history on the mock feed
  and uses series whose strike lies in the past.
- **The Desk's LP flows pause while any held series can't be quoted** (weekends, pending
  fixing). Otherwise the share price would be unknown.
